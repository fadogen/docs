## What is Fadogen?

**Fadogen** is a free and open-source, native macOS application that lets you **create, develop, deploy, and operate** PHP applications from a single place.

It replaces a fragmented toolchain with one coherent workflow:

- no Homebrew
- no custom Docker setup
- no paid deployment platforms
- no credentials stored on third-party servers

Just install Fadogen, describe your project, and ship.

---

## A complete workflow, end to end

Fadogen covers the **entire lifecycle** of your application:

1. Generate a Laravel or Symfony project
2. Develop locally with HTTPS and isolated runtimes
3. Generate production-ready infrastructure and CI/CD
4. Provision servers and deploy with zero downtime
5. Backup and restore data automatically

All from the same app.
