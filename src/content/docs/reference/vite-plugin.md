title: Vite Plugin
description: Automatically configure HTTPS for new Laravel projects.
---

The `@fadogen/vite-plugin` package automatically configures HTTPS for the Vite development server by loading TLS certificates generated by Fadogen.

:::tip[Automatic setup]
When creating a new Laravel project from the Fadogen app, this plugin is automatically installed and configured.
:::

This plugin avoids having to manually set the `VITE_DEV_SERVER_KEY` and `VITE_DEV_SERVER_CERT` environment variables in your `.env` file.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D @fadogen/vite-plugin
```

## Configuration

In your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
import fadogen from '@fadogen/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    laravel({
      input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
      refresh: true,
    }),
    fadogen(),
  ],
})
```

:::caution[Laravel Herd users]
If you have Laravel Herd installed, you must disable its automatic TLS detection by adding `detectTls: false` to the Laravel plugin:

```ts
laravel({
  input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
  refresh: true,
  detectTls: false,
}),
```

Otherwise, Vite will fail to start due to conflicting TLS configurations.
:::

## How It Works

The plugin automatically detects TLS certificates generated by Fadogen:

1. Gets the project folder name
2. Converts it to a valid domain name (e.g., `my-project` → `my-project.localhost`)
3. Looks for certificates in the Fadogen data folder
4. Configures the Vite server to use HTTPS with these certificates

### Certificate Location

Certificates are stored in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Fadogen/data/caddy/certificates/local/{domain}/
```

### Project Name Conversion

The folder name is converted to a valid hostname (RFC 1123):

| Folder Name | Generated Domain |
|-------------|------------------|
| `my-project` | `my-project.localhost` |
| `My Project` | `my-project.localhost` |
| `my_project` | `my-project.localhost` |

:::note
The project must first be added to Fadogen for certificates to be generated.
:::

## Logs

The plugin displays messages in the console:

```
[@fadogen/vite-plugin] Using certificates for: my-project.localhost
```

If certificates are not found:

```
[@fadogen/vite-plugin] Certificates not found at: ~/Library/Application Support/...
```
